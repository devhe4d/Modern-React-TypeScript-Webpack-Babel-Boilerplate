# Modern-React-TypeScript-Webpack-Babel-Boilerplate
I have created this as a practice to learn more about Webpack and Babel internal works, so it is basically a mimic of Create-React-App ( maybe better in some way? ðŸ¥¸ ) but you have full control of Webpack and Babel.

It is strongly opinionated, but I tried to apply some of "Best Practices" here and there and finally I publish it here in case anyone wants to create their own project from scratch and want to use this as a guide or anything.


Cheers!
